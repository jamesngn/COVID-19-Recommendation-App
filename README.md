- **Symptom Recording:** Record and update patient symptoms to assess their condition accurately.
- **High-Risk Locations:** Store information about high-risk locations to identify potential outbreaks and hotspots.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and user-friendly menu for easy navigation and efficient usage.

## Technology

- **Front-end:** The solution is built using command line prompt to display information to the patient.
- **Back-end:** The back-end is developed using C++ to handle data storage and processing data.
- **Database:** The system utilizes Text Document as the database for storing patient information and high-risk location data.

## How to Install

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/jamesngn/COVID-19-Recommendation-App.git`
2. Open the terminal (cmd).
3. Navigate to the directory where the C++ source code and executable are located. You can use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:
```
cd /path/to/your/source/code.
```
5.  Compile the C++ source code to create an executable file. Use a C++ compiler like g++ (GNU Compiler Collection) to compile the code. The command may look like this:
```
g++ MainProgram.cpp -o MainProgram
```

6. Once the compilation is successful, you can run the executable by typing its name in the terminal/command prompt and pressing Enter. For example:
```
./MainProgram
```

7. Now, your C++ command-line prompt application should be running, and you can interact with it using the terminal/command prompt.
