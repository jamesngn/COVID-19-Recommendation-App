# COVID-19-Recommendation-App
Hi guys, the software designed in C++ basically is a good solution for tracking the COVID-19 patients and their health status. Further, the software has an ability to store the high-risk locations, patient's information and symptoms that can be updated depending on situation. 
I hope it is helpful for the community in the future.
